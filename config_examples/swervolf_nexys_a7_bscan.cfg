# Based on original OpenOCD configuration by Olof Kindgren,
# https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-SweRVolf/blob/master/data/swervolf_nexys_debug.cfg

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This OpenOCD configuration uses FTDI USB-to-serial chip that is integrated
# as an on-board component on Nexys A7 FPGA board.
#
# JTAG connection to SweRV processor is in SweRVolf tunneled through the JTAG
# interface of the FPGA component itself (BSCAN IP by Xilinx is utilized).
#
# As a result, it is not neccessary to use a separate USB-to-JTAG adapter
# for SweRVolf. It suffices to have just a single USB cable between the
# dev board and your workstation that will be used for:
#  - powering the board
#  - interacting with the FPGA (loading bitstream)
#  - on-chip debugging of SweRVolf (JTAG tunneled through BSCAN)
